### A sonic correspondence between Morocco and Spain

{% picture jpt-webp  "projects/bendir1.jpg" --link {{ page.external_link }} %}

## Artists
Disco Atlas (Morocco) & Sono Mayrit (Spain)

Back-to-back collaboration between two researchers and selectors working through sound.


## Project Summary
Bendir Ghayta Ribab, Pandero Gaita Ravel! is a sonic exploration of shared instrumental
traditions between rural Morocco and the Iberian Peninsula. It is not a remix project, nor a
genre blend — but rather a research-driven sound practice focused on the timbres,
textures, and evolutions of traditional instruments, presented in back-to-back DJ sets using
field recordings and archival materials.


Through active listening and deep digging, the project surfaces rural and ceremonial soundscapes
where similar instruments — such as the bendir and pandero, ghayta and gaita, ribab and
rabel — have developed in parallel yet distinct cultural contexts. The focus is not only on
similarity, but also on difference, and how each tradition evolved its own sonic identity.

## Aims and Objectives
- To highlight shared sonic lineages between Morocco and Spain using specific traditional
instruments.
- To question the idea of national sound by presenting instruments that exist across
borders.
- To activate field recordings and archival material as creative tools, not just historical
references.
- To engage listeners through sound-based storytelling that avoids exoticization or
romanticism.
- To document and circulate underrepresented acoustic traditions in a contemporary
setting.


## Methodology
- Sound-based research focused on archival recordings, cassettes, vinyl, and field recordings
from rural regions in Morocco and Spain.
- Back-to-back DJ performances, each artist curating from their own archive, drawing lines
of correspondence between instruments, tonalities, and performance contexts.
- Instrument-focused curation, highlighting the evolution of similar tools (bendir/pandero,
ghayta/gaita, ribab/rabel) in different sonic ecosystems.


## Artistic Relevance
This project proposes an alternative way of listening to Western Mediterranean heritage — not
through fusions or pastiche, but through attentive selection and juxtaposition. It invites
audiences to hear how traditions travel, how they resist erasure, and how sound carries
memory across geography and time.


## Target Audience
Listeners and audiences interested in sound-based practices, oral traditions, acoustic
heritage, experimental DJ culture, and decolonial approaches to music. Cultural institutions,
sound art festivals, experimental music programs, and spaces engaged with Mediterranean
or postcolonial dialogues.

## Presentation Format
Live sound performance (back-to-back DJ set) using analog and digital media, a listening session format with seated audience and enhanced sound system.
Possibility of accompanying talk or discussion about methodology and research, if the
context allows.
