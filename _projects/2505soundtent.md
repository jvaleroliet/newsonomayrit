Starting at dawn on Saturday 3 May 2025, close to the Greenwich Meridian, Reveil made its 24-hour live broadcast, moving from one stream to the next as the sun rose around the globe, connecting microphones and listeners across time zones.

Built a streambox (with DIY microphones + Raspberry PI Zero) and placed in [ElisaBeet social garden](https://streams.soundtent.org/2025/streams/utc2_-9c7e0d40-3f21-4849-8ef4-a3acc1042219), Wedding, Berlin. You were able to hear birds, insects, and the city slowly waking up.
