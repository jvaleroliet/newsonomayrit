### *Sonic Imaginaries of Flamenco* 


<br>


Sonic Imaginaries is Iranian-Dutch DJ Katayoun's new Outsiders show with sounds spanning from soulful Persian Avaz to jazzy tunes, upbeat funk, Latin rhythms and synth, bringing to the fore sweeping sounds and lesser known gems in her sets by way of musical storytelling.

In this episode, Katayoun invited Sono Mayrit to discuss and research how rumba influenced some Tehran bands in the 70's era, and how even today we can still hear the flamenco presence in Iranian music.
