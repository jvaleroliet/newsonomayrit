    “Olive Harvest Soundscapes” is a sonic-archival project exploring the connections between the olive harvest season across the Mediterranean. Created by radio producer Sono Mayrit, this unique project explores the songs, flavours and rituals that accompany the powerful tradition of harvesting olives, digging into the profound significance of its socio-cultural narratives.

    For centuries, the olive harvest season - a time of communal labor and celebration - has been accompanied by rituals, songs and traditions that reflect the enduring connection between people and the land. As such, the olive tree transcends its botanical identity and serves as a symbol of intergenerational connectivity, cultural resistance and ecological sustainability.
    
    Given its multidimensional values and powerful role within its communities, “Olive Harvest Soundscapes” seeks to present an immersive , creative and well-rounded perspective on the ways olive trees are so deeply embedded into the social imaginary across the Mediterranean -  focusing on the songs, soundscapes, rituals, cuisines, political threats and cultural legacy around their harvest season.</p>

    In addition, this project focuses on the importance of olive trees as past, present and future catalysts for cultural and ecological resilience across the Mediterranean. From Palestine’s land dispossession caused by Israel’s occupation to climate change affecting Southern Europe and North Africa, this project investigates the ways in which the loss of these trees go beyond socio-economic losses, exploring the impacts on identity, tradition and spirit.
